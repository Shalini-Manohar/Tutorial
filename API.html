            <h1 style="font-size: 35px;">HTML Drag and Drop</h1><br>
            <p><b>HTML Drag and Drop</b> (DnD) is a feature of HTML5. It is a powerful user interface concept which is used to copy, reorder and delete items with the help of mouse. You can hold the mouse button down over an element and drag it to another location. If you want to drop the element there, just release the mouse button.<br>

                If you want to achieve the Drag and Drop functionality in traditional HTML4, you must either have to use complex JavaScript programming or other JavaScript frameworks like jQuery etc.
            </p><br>
            <h2>Events for Drag and Drop feature</h2><br>
            <img src="img/drag and drop.jpeg"><br><br>
            <h2>Drag and Drop Example</h2><br>
            <p>Let's see an example of HTML 5 drag and drop feature.</p><br>
            <img src="img/dd example.jpeg"><br><br>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Geolocation</h2><br>
            <p>The Geolocation is one of the best HTML5 API which is used to identify the user's geographic location for the web application.<br>

                This new feature of HTML5 allows you to navigate the latitude and longitude coordinates of the current website's visitor.<br> These coordinates can be captured by JavaScript and send to the server which can show your current location on the website<br>
                
                Most of the geolocation services use Network routing addresses such as IP addresses, RFID, WIFI and MAC addresses or internal GPS devices to identify the user's location.

            <h3>Syntax:</h3><br>
            <img  src="img/geo syntax.jpeg"><br>
            <p>If this object is present, then you can get the geolocation services.</p><br>
            <h3>Geolocation Methods:</h3><br>
            <p>The Geolocation API uses three methods of Geolocation interface which are given following:</p><br>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">HTML Web Storage</h2><br>
            <p>The Web Storage is one of the great features of HTML5. With the Web Storage feature, web applications can locally store data within the browser on the client side.<br> It stores data in the form of key/value pair on the browser. Web Storage sometimes also known as DOM storage.

                Storing data with the help of web storage is similar to cookies, but it is better and faster than cookies storage.<br>
                
                In compared to cookies Web Storage has Following Advantages:<br><br>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                    Web Storage can use storage space upto 5MB per domain. (The browser software may prompt the user if the space limit is reached).<br>
                    It will not send data to the server side, hence it is faster than cookies storage.<br>
                    The data stored by local Storage never expires, but cookies data expires after some time or session.<br>
                    Web Storage is more secure than cookies.<br>
                </p><br>
                <h2>Types of Web Storage</h2><br>
                <p>There are two types of web storage with different scope and lifetime.</p><br>
                <p><b>Local Storage:</b> Local Storages uses Windows.localStaorage object which stores data and available for every page. But data persist even if the browser is closed and reopened (Stores data with no Expiration).<br>
                   <b>Session Storage:</b> Session Storage uses Windows.sessionStorage object which stores data for one session and data will be lost if the window or browser tab will be closed.
                </p><br>
                <h2>The localStorage Object:</h2><br>
                <p>The localStorage object stores data locally within the browser. The data stored by localStroage object does not have any expiration date. Hence the stored data will not be deleted if the browser is closed or reopened.<br>

                    Each piece of data is stored in simple key-value pairs. The key/values are always stored as String, and can be accessed with localStorage.getItem() and localStorage.setItem() methods.
                </p><br>
                <h3>Example:</h3>
                <img src="img/localstorage example.jpeg"><br><br>
                <h2>The sessionStorage Object:</h2><br>
                <p>The sessionStorage object is same as the localStorage object, but the difference is that it stores data only for one session.<br> If you close the browser, then data will be lost or deleted.
                </p><br>
                <h3>Example:</h3>
                <img src="img/sessionstorage example.jpeg"><br>
